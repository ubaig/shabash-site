### Can multiple parents manage the same family?
Yes. Once you invite another parent using their email, they will have equal access to chores, rewards, and settings for the family.

### How do kids log in?
Kids don't need to login, either a parent or adult can login the site and switch to kids mode, or parents can go to settings and generate a family shared link and open the app using that on kids devices. Kids cannot modify family settings.

### What happens if I forget my password?
Use the **Forgot Password** link on the sign-in page. A reset code will be sent to your registered email.

### Can I delete a chore or reward?
Parents (and admins) can delete chores and rewards. Deleting a chore also removes any associated star transactions.

### How are stars awarded and spent?
Stars are earned when a chore is marked complete and optionally approved by a parent. They can be spent on rewards defined in the reward catalog. Parents can require approval before a star deduction occurs.

### Is there a mobile app?
The current version of Shabash is a responsive web application optimized for phones and tablets. Simply open the site in your mobile browser and add it to your home screen.
