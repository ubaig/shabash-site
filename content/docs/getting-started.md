Welcome to **Shabash**! This guide will walk you through the basic steps to start managing chores with your family.

## 1. Create a Family Account

1. Navigate to the homepage and click **Get Started**.
2. Fill out your email, display name, and password. An email verification code will be sent to you.
3. Enter the code to verify your email and activate your account.

By default, the first user becomes a family parent and a new family is created. You can invite other parents and children later.

## 2. Invite Family Members

- Go to the **Users** section in the sidebar.
- Click **Add User** and enter the new member's email, display name, and role (Parent or Kid).
- Kids will receive an invitation email with a temporary password and instructions to log in.

Parents share access to the same chore and reward lists, while kids have restricted permissions.

## 3. Add Chores

- Click **Chores** and choose **New Chore**.
- Provide a title, description, star value, schedule (daily, weekly, etc.), and assign it to a family member.
- You can categorize chores using buckets such as "Morning" or "Weekend".
- If a chore requires approval, the child must submit it for review before earning stars.

Chores appear on everyone's dashboard, and completion triggers real-time notifications.

## 4. Set Up Rewards

- Open the **Rewards** section and select **New Reward**.
- Define a reward name, star cost, optional image, and whether parental approval is required.
- Kids can browse available rewards and claim them when they have enough stars.

Rewards help motivate children to stay on top of their tasks.

## 5. Use the Calendar

- The **Calendar** page shows chores and custom events in a familiar month/week view.
- Add events like appointments, family meetings, or due dates.
- Configure email reminders and mobile notifications in **Settings**.

Enjoy keeping the whole family organized!
