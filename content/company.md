Shabash wasn't started in a boardroom. It was started in a living room, amidst a pile of laundry and the familiar refrain of *"Is it my turn to feed the dog?"*

As parents, we tried every sticker chart, app, and spreadsheet imaginable. Some were too complex, some were full of ads, and most just didn't respect our family's privacy. We wanted a tool that didn't just track tasks, but taught our children the **value of contribution** and the **joy of shared responsibility**.

So, we built it ourselves.

### Developed by Parents, for Parents
We understand that parenting is hard enough without having to fight with technology. That's why Shabash is built with three core principles:

1.  **Simplicity First**: It should take seconds to assign a chore or approve a reward.
2.  **Privacy as a Right**: We would never sell our our own kids' data, and we'll never sell yours. Shabash is a private space for your family.
3.  **Positive Reinforcement**: We focus on "Shabash" (an Urdu term for "Well Done" or "Bravo"). We're here to celebrate the wins, big and small.

### Our Mission
Our mission is to empower families to work together, build life-long habits, and celebrate achievements in a safe, digital environment. 

We are a small, dedicated team. We use Shabash with our own families every single day, and we're constantly improving it based on what works for us—and for you.
