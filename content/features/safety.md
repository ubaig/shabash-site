# Your Family's Safety is Our Top Priority

At Shabash, we believe that a tool for families must be built on a foundation of trust. Because we are parents ourselves, we've designed Shabash with the same level of security and privacy we demand for our own children.

## Privacy by Design

Unlike many other apps, Shabash is not built on data collection. We have a very simple philosophy: **Your data belongs to you.**

- **Zero Third-Party Ads**: We will never clutter our app with ads or expose your children to commercial tracking.
- **No Data Selling**: We have never and will never sell your family's personal information to advertisers or data brokers.
- **Minimal Data Collection**: We only collect the information necessary to provide the service.

## Security Measures

We use industry-standard security to ensure your data stays where it belongs.

- **Encrypted Connections**: All data transmitted between your device and our servers is protected by SSL/TLS encryption.
- **Secure Authentication**: We use modern, secure login methods to prevent unauthorized access to your account.
- **Regular Audits**: We constantly review our code and infrastructure to protect against new threats.

## Developed for Families

Shabash is focused on creates a positive, safe environment for kids to learn. 

- **Protected Profiles**: Kids use simplified, protected profiles within the family account.
- **Parental Controls**: Parents have full control over all chores, rewards, and star balances.
- **Safe Feedback**: We listen to our users to ensure the app remains a healthy part of family life.

> "As a developer and a dad, I wouldn't let my kids use an app I didn't trust 100%. That's the bar we set for Shabash every single day."
