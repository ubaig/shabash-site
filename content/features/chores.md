## Keep Everyone on Task

Shabash makes chore management collaborative. Parents and children can view the same list of tasks and check them off as they are completed. With clear schedules and flexible assignment options, daily routines become easier to manage.

### Key Highlights

- **Assign to any family member** – choose who should be responsible for each chore.
- **Editable by both parents** – families can add or modify chores together.
- **Mark as complete** with one tap from the dashboard.
- **Automatic reminders** ensure important chores aren't missed.

### How It Works

1. Parent creates a new chore with title, description, emoji, and star value.
2. Select a frequency and who it's assigned to.
3. Child sees the chore on their dashboard and marks it done when finished.
4. Parent approves (if required) and stars are added to the kid's balance.

Chores can be paused or archived when they are no longer needed, keeping the list clean and focused.
