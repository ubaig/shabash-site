## Reward Good Work

Turning chores into a game keeps kids motivated. With Shabash, every completed task earns stars that can be spent on rewards chosen by the family. This positive reinforcement encourages responsibility and makes household chores enjoyable.

### Rewards Workflow

- **Parents set up rewards** with a title, cost and optional expiration or limit.
- **Kids browse the store** to see what they can earn and plan their efforts.
- **Claiming an item** triggers an optional approval step for parents.
- **Stars are deducted** only after approval to keep balances accurate.

Badges and achievements appear automatically when children hit milestones, providing extra encouragement and a sense of accomplishment.
